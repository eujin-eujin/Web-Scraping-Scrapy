Usually when an electronic item is sold, seller won't care the customer. Not even think about a replacement, but i can tell you that this Oakter team is the best in that. My product stopped working after 3 months. I informed them the same and they just checked with the minimal enquiries and within 3 days they have replaced it with a new product. Just amazing the way they deal with the service given to customer. As a customer I am really thankful with the service you endeavored with me. And recommend with 10 ⭐."

After reading some negative reviews I wanted to test it. I got exact 2 hr 30 min backup with this mini UPS. I'm using Jio fibre router.Also there support is good. To clear few doubts I contacted them in WhatsApp. Komal helped me to resolve my doubts with clarity.If I got 4 hr backup then I could have given 5 star. FYI - it has 2000 mAh battery.

Both are working great and while on paper they claim 4hrs, in real life, i was getting around 2 - 2.5 hrs of backup with this.There was a difference in the form factor between the two purchases: The one from 2022 was a bit more compact compared to the 2023 version. Personally, I like the 2022 version better.A negative is that in both versions, the charging led is barely noticeable/ dosent exist. In the 2022 version, there is a green charging led but you need to look very closely to see it. In the 2023 version, it is not at all present. A properly visible charging LED would have been nice."

They were very polite and helpful throughout the process. It was very easy for me to explain the issue to them then at the end of the first conversation itself they arranged a replacement for the product since it is just 3-4 months old. They took all the responsibility of the issue and sent me a new product which I am currently using, now the back up I am getting is 4+ hours which is based on my usage.So finally I am not sure how often I buy a product from this brand but I will never forget the support I received from this this brand.

After getting it checked I found out that the issue was in the UPS (maybe wiring cable) which stopped transmission.I contacted the customer care and I was assisted by Mr. Ankit. He was very helpful and asked me to demonstrate the issue in video and tried to ascertain the issue through other checkups too. After ascertaining that the issue is in the product he confirmed to get the default product replaced and started the issue and informed me on tentative timelines for the same. Hoping to receive the replacement soon so that I can continue uninterrupted internet !!"

Not a traditional UPS instead it's more of a use & throw chinese product!,"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR: Not a UPS*, designed to be thrown in trash barely over it's warranty period! :(-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# Ｃｏｎｔｅｘｔ• So, I bought this little over an year ago just to have some power backup from my router in case of a brown out which is eventually taken care by my society's power backup within 30 seconds. So, I had no heavy duty usecase for this product, but much needed during Zoom meetings while working from home.• In just ~12th month, I started noticing that my router used to reboot despite no power cut. It was quite strange but I ruled it out from some problem from Airtel's side.# Ｅｘｐｅｒｉｍｅｎｔ• Last month, this started happening multiple times a day, so just like any other scientist, I decided to run an experiment, to rule out if my router has gone bad, I disconnected this Oakter miniUPS and ran my router without any backup and it worked perfectly.• To make sure it's the Oakter's device at fault, I decided to deep charge it for whole night and then connected my router, but same result, inconsistent reboots.# Ｃｕｓｔｏｍｅｒ Ｓｕｐｐｏｒｔ• I decided to try my luck with the customer support service, but after taking a look at the invoice, they just shrugged and said ""We can't help"".• I didn't want to throw this in the trash and end in the landfill so I even asked if they can provide any battery replacements service since it's the clear case of battery degradation, but no help because ofcourse this just yet another rebranded chinese product meant to be thrown away once used.# Ｄｅｂｕｇｇｉｎｇ• Then, I decided to debug and understand why did the batteries deplete so quickly despite seldom use of ~30 seconds handful times in last 1 year as mentioned above. As you can observed in pictures attached, it's quite poorly soldered and taped together with the power board and the daughter board.• Upon inspecting with my multimeter, I observed an interesting thing. This is not built like traditional UPS which runs of the AC mains power while connected and only in the case of powercut, it quickly falls back to the battery backup (usually within ~5ms).• This Oakter MiniUPS product just keeps charging the battery 24/7 and powers the router via battery backup all the time, resulting in..., you guessed it, serious battery degradation once the battery can't provide suitable voltage to the router resulting in undervolting of router, leading to it's reboot.# Ｖｅｒｄｉｃｔ• It's a shame that Oakter promises to be an ""Original Design Manufacturer"" on their homepage and yet they can't design a sustainable and repairable product.• As an engineer I understand that the smart switch method like traditional UPS may drive up the cost or cut in your profit margins, but this product is just a cheap powerback with a soldered barrel port and some adapters.• I would expect the team to atleast think about refurbishing the product at some cost to save this device ending up in landfill in bulk once it's lifecycle is over. Swapping the unit ~50% of price might make good economic sense for both company and the customer.EDIT: Seems like their competitor - Cuzor is providing battery refurbishing services at some cost! A great initiative, what's stopping you - Oakter?"

One of my neighbour used Resonate where I found it as a good one as I physically verified.The rating for Oakter is below than resonate but Amazon offered this at Rs. 999/ which is half of resonate so I thought I will give a try. As usual based on some of the reviews, I received a defective product where I followed all instructions to charge it for 6 hrs. before first use but no use. It never charged by router. I think Lithium cells became dead. Thanks to Amazon for smooth customer support where I immediately reported and ordered for replacement within 7 days.  If you  missed to order the replacement within 7 days, then you would loose the money because there is no refund policy.I tested the backup of replacement one initially for 3 hrs. It was a smooth transition from power to backup mode without any  disruption in the internet. Then I really tested for full battery backup. It gave the power for 3.5 hrs (not as per the manual where it was told it will give backup for 4 hrs.). I do not have frequent power cut in my area but I am cautious about Monsoon coming in 2 months. I am satisfied with the product. Need to check how it will retain this backup period after 2 or 3 months. Also excited how log this product will have life as batteries usually wont last more than 3 years.I gave 4 rating because I have doubt on seller whether he purposely send a defective product and if people does not report within 7 day replacement policy, he could resist the replacement. This  has been reported by many buyers that they initially got a defective one but replacement was working fine.Also there is no refund policy to note. Hence be cautious on this.Otherwise thanks to seller for a very good deal on this ups."

My wi-fi router switches to back up within mili-seconds once the MSEB supply is gone. For me this product gives 2-2.5 hours of seamless power supply to my wi-fi router during power cuts.

However, it's not a paid review. Giving my genuine review.It was one of the most easy to install plug-n-play device I've seen in the recent time. Consumes very less space and has a good power backup. Purchased it due to frequent power issues at home during WFH meetings. It's a big relief. I have connected the router to the power backup that my society provides. However, it comes after a minute. So the router restarts 2 times in this flow. And with the boot time of the fiber routers, you know how much of a pain is it. This was a life saver device for me to solve this problem.Keywords:- Good Backup- Small & Easy Going with any 9v/12v routers- Installable by Amateurs (just connect the power adapter of the router to this device & from this device to your router and its done) - Manufacturers told me charge the device fully for first time use which I did not do. But it still is working fine for me. Just sharing information that I received.-"

My society doesn’t have frequent power cuts or no power for long duration. I installed this Mini UPS to avoid interruption in online meetings due to common power cuts which would barely last for 2 minutes and backed up by DG immediately. So I haven’t been able to check if it actually lasts for 3-4 hours as mentioned but before writing this review I checked, I turned off the power supply of the UPS and it lasted for 40 minutes only. So anyone who has similar society conditions like me can buy but if you are looking for 3-4 hours of backup, I won’t recommend because it lasted for 40 minutes only when I tested."

I even recommended it to a friend !I have frequent power cuts where I live so this little device helps me through it by letting me stay connected to the internet and not be bored during the power cut 😂The second device had an issue where it would lose power on its own and once I turn it off and on again, it would work fine.I reached out to the support team via WhatsApp and Prashanth from Oakter was kind enough to support me and he even organised a hassle-free replacement of the defective device.This goes to show the brand’s commitment towards their customers and their products.10/10 would recommend this product for those without a home UPS."

If you see so many reviews for this product, you now know why. Please note that buying from Amazon gives a 6 month warranty, and buying from the vendor's website gives a 1 year warranty.With the above disclaimer out of the way, here is my review on using this product for a few days. The reason for buying a UPS for the modem was to protect against the power fluctuations, milli-second drops and not for prolonged power outages.I have been using this MiniUPS for over a week and its performance has been excellent for the above use case. There has not been a single instance of the modem restarting due to power fluctuations. Setup is very straightforward and the accompanying booklet provides sufficient information. I have not tested for how long the battery lasts as that is not important for me.I have used the MiniUPS with the BSNL FFTH modem (Alphion AONT-100) and with the JioFiber modem/router and it has worked flawlessly with both of these devices.If I had to nit-pick it is on two counts - one, the led indicator is way too bright, and two, the accompanying wire is a bit short, should have been a bit longer."

And again when the main power supply returns, it again turns off all the devices. Mostly the power outage happens when i am doing some critical work or watching a match or a movie. Having this UPS has made the experience too good and the wifi signal/connection is now always up and running as the router never turns off due to unextected outages. Its been more than a month and i have noticed no issues with this UPS.I would highly recommend purchasing this router UPS to have a smooth uninterrupted router connectivity. Company claims 4 hrs backup. Which should be sufficient for most of the users requirement."

However, I purchased the 12V one and not the 9V one. I never faced any issues with the router till now. In fact have been using it faultlessly during multiple power cuts (backup coming on and then backup switching off resulted in a switch on/off of WiFi router earlier) that I have faced between Jan end and May 2022.But today it stopped working when there was a power cut. As in the device doesn't behave like a UPS and the WiFi router switched off when there was a power cut. I connected with the number provided by Oakter over WhatsApp. Amazingly, the Oakter representative Prashanth Kotte really helped me with the issue. He said a 9V UPS would be better for me and placed a replacement order for a 9V one instead of this 12V UPS. Hope to get the 9V UPS in a week's time."

Using for 2 months now. Faced router reboot issue once but it got resolved automagically. Still good performance.However if you're into electronics you can construct this device by yourself like I did after buying this ;)

I attributed this to be a charging indication and thought the one that did not show the glow had the batteries fully charged at delivery itself. But even after 6 hrs of charging the glow remained on one unit . I tested the backup for about 10 minutes and both kept supplying my modems with sufficient power. I let the one with the glow kept on charging overnight and it did extinguish the glow. But it returned next day and this unit failed  just within 10 days of purchase. The other kept performing to my satisfaction . I reported this to oakter and the response was prompt and after checking through whatsapp a few tech details I was promised a replacement which did take place in about 5 days from my first contact with oakter and it was hastle free . Although the replacement has some trivial issues like the top cover coming off it is working alright. Over all the product meets my needs with the minor issues mentioned above (loose top cover in one unit and no glow iin the other) though it does show a lapse in QC of the product, but certainly the customer care has to be applauded for their prompt and useful service.Two months on wards: The same ups has gone dead  again, the battery is not gerring charged, probably dead short as the router power adaptor now cannot power up the router when connected through this mini  ups. Although the Oakter help desk team was ready to help out, I decided to discard the product as it certainly is poor in quality, failed completely twice (original and replacement) in a period of 3 months, so not reliable"

My existing router adapter jack didn't fit into the socket (IN) of this mini UPS. And the connector provided with the UPS cannot be connected to any socket..!! Not sure whether the connector provided is the apt one.I used my earlier UPS (Resonate) connector cable and it worked with the Oakter UPS...!! I am happy it worked.Another draw back is there is no charging indicator. Not sure why one of the most basic and easy to implement feature is missing.The UPS is working as stated. Yet to see the the battery life.

It has been more than a month since I purchased this ups for my router. It works fine. Only concern which I came across is the backup time which is quite low of about 1 hour when there is a powercut. In places like mine where there will be power shut down for about 8 hours every month, I should opt for a better backup time ups but that wouldn't be economical. It is said that this has a backup time upto 4 hours but it did not went that long, but it is not a big deal for this price range."

It works","This product has been delivered in broken condition and there is no return or replace option with the same.Updating this review after almost a month.  I had purchased their Mini UPS for WiFi router from Amazon. The first piece received was in broken condition since the packing was extremely flimsy. On receiving a call from the Oakter CC team and on informing them of the situation, they promptly said that they would replace the same immediately. The second piece dispatched was also received in broken condition.. The packing was again done very poorly and hence the courier delivered a broken piece. Again, the CC team called and I shared the situation with pictures of the same. The CC team was again very supportive and said that they will send another piece even though i said it was not required since I had repaired the 1st piece with tape and fevikwik. Aakash Tyagi from their CC team was extremely supportive and took my feedback on their packaging and delivery partner. Finally, the 3rd piece was received very well packaged and this time through Blue Dart who carried the shipment without wrecking it. 4 stars for their CC team and the product which by the way does it's job.. Gives a back up of close to 4 hours and seamless wifi experience even during power outages. Its a boon for WFH. Deducting one star for the packaging and delivery experience. Best wishes to the Oakter team."

Thanks to Amazon delivery, it was delivered on the same day. On installing both, one worked, and the other did not. As per the instruction, I allowed it to get charged for over 12hrs, but no luck. It did not work. I raised a complaint with Amazon and Oakter support desk. The support team asked all basic questions even after stating your product is powering up!. They wanted the first photo of the router adapter with its rating. Later they asked about the video of the connection and product. That process took over 2hrs before the support team accepted them for replacement. The courier team collected the defective product the following day. But for the replacement to reach it took 5day! Felt bad about it. But finally, it worked. Happy with the support team of Oakter."

While there is power backup at home, I wanted a mini-UPS for my wi-fi to support the switch-over time between DG and Mains. The product initially worked like a charm, seamlessly switching between AC and battery power enabling uninterrupted wi-fi. But just in November (5 months later), I noticed that the product had stopped working and everytime the supply switched between DG to Mains and back, my router would restart.When I called customer care, they immediately gathered the product details and invoice and I got a phone call offering either replacement or refund. But as I was using a 5V router and they only had a 12V option, they immediately agreed to a refund. Within a week, the product was picked up and after a few follow-ups, the amount was refunded.The 4-stars are for the excellent warranty policy and customer care services offered. They are quick to respond and transparent with the process."

Best value for money product as the competitors seems to be priced near to 2k. I bought it around 1.1k which is a definite margin.2. The connection is too simple to make. They give you an adapeter cable as well which would fit an entire spectrum of wall warts which comes with normal modems.3. The company call for a routine check of your product which was when i detected an issue with the back up of my unit. Recently i noticed that my backup is only 30mins. At first i thought that these devices truly give that much only yet they claim few couple of hours in their advertisements. But the service engg said that is the issue with my particular unit and readily issued a replacement. Which i am yet to receive at the time of writing this review. But still i am quite happy with the way they dealt the issue. You know normally they don't admit these kinds of faults especially if it is on theirs side. A big shout out for oakter for being this customer friendly.So at the moment, i am waiting for the replacement to come. Maybe i will put a complete review in a week or two when i get the new unit."

The on/off button on power backup should only charge the device itself and not restrict the supply to the router."

Oakter have since discontinued this model, maybe due to the high failure rate. However, their support makes up for the product failures. They accepted replacement requests both times, without questions. The 2nd time, since the model I had bought was discontinued, they replaced it with a newer model.Overall, would recommend both the brand and their support team.Note: They ask that you review them and give you additional warranty for reviewing, however, they don't ask you for a 5* review like some of those sub-standard sellers/brands out there. Looks like they want honest reviews. :) A good sign, I'd say."

Thanks to Amazon also having good distributors like Oakter company. I liked the response of team unit of customer care who replies and gives immediately response and solve the problem. Friends I would like to share few words about product as the amp raises of router the backup time is less example if it's 0.5 amps router backup gives for four hours and if router is 2.5 amps as my jio router backup gives for one and half hours exact.

Using with Airtel/Nokia 12VDC 1.5A Wi-Fi Router. Worth 5 stars, go for it.","A very compact and true Mini UPS I have purchased on top of all other DC Power Backup solutions available in the market for Wi-Fi routers. Thank you, Oakter Team for the great product.I'm adding my review after using the Oakter All in One Mini UPS for 10 days. The product was delivered on 31st March... thank you, Amazon for the fast delivery.I'm using it with Nokia 12VDC 1.5A Wi-Fi Router for my Airtel broadband connection. So far it's working fine and providing an uninterrupted power supply. I need it only for a short period as I have power backup that turns on within a minute, however, the company claims 60-90 minutes backup. And, it can easily continue to run a wi-fi router for 60 plus minutes that I have tested with my Nokia 12v wi-fi router. I'll update my further experience after using it for a month.Thanks to two universal sockets that enable the option to connect two devices at a time if required.I also appreciate the outstanding customer support. The Oakter team contacted me to answer any questions and to check if I need any support related to the product. They have also confirmed Mini UPS can be left 24*7 to ensure an uninterrupted power supply to the connected appliances. Thank you, Aakash Tyagi for your outstanding customer support and for taking the time to call and address all my questions.I would recommend this Mini UPS to all those who are working from home, joining online classes, or online meetings and have a problem with power cuts, or those who are residing in an area with regular power fluctuations, like me."

When the power came back it would not allow Wi-Fi router to boot up as the UPS kept failing to provide power to router. Then I had to disconnect router and charge UPS for some time to resume operation. If battery is drained then UPS should provide power bypassing the battery and charge itself in the meantime.Once or twice in a day my wifi router restarts for no reason even when there is no power cut. So I assume there is some serious flaw with UPS circuit.Updates: the router backup time went to zero in 8 months. While it was still in warranty period I was able to get a replacement.

That too for a reliable product.Had used resonate ups in the past but it's battery can't provide backup after almost 5 years. But i am not buying another resonate router for 2k

It works perfect fine.Per a few days of observation, if the router works continuously for 3 hours on power outage. After power restoration, you have to unplug the connecter from round and let it charge UPS for few mins and then connect ups connecter to router. This way it works perfectly for Jio routers.Did not see these kind of issues with my other Linksys router."

Rajvanshi,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a cost worthy product. It works well👍,"It's a nice product, definitely it provides power back up, it does its job well. But it can provide a maximum of 2 to 2.5 hours of power back up for a 12.0v - 2.0A output wifi router. So don't expect more than this, unlike the description in ads which promises upto 4 hours of power back up . No, not at all.☝️"

It was a problem with my modem adapter. With a adapter provided by oakter, the issue got resolved.One noteworthy point : Generally, with any product, the customer does annoying follow ups. But in this case it is Oakter who did follow ups with me till they resolved my issue by sending a support engineer. Kudos to their Customer Support team. I change my rating now to 5 stars, mainly owing to their support..Read on below to understand my earlier issue. I had rated 1 star earlier..(28-Feb-2021) : My review is about Oakter Mini UPS ALL-IN-ONE, photo of which i have attached (i am specifying this because there are reviews on the same page for diffetent products). The Oakter Mini UPS ALL-IN-ONE doesn't work for my Airtel modem. I went for this one because i wanted single ups device for my modem and router (Aiterl Broadband has modem+router) and this unit has two power sockets to connect both.But when connected to this, my router starts but not my modem..Oakter support is prompt and they replaced the unit 3 times for me.. But all three units - same problem - not able to power the modem (12 v 1.5 amps) but router (12 v 0.5 amps) gets connected. Not sure of the problem, so i ask the qiestion.. it cant take the load of 1.5 amps modem?"

When fully charged it will give back up for atleast 1.25 hours...tested till that long only. Earlier I got just 3-4 minutes back up and was very unhappy.  Customer care suggested this to do. Actually it recharges very slowly. Also my product had some issues, so it was replaced.  With new one I m not getting any issues as such. The only not so good part of this product is it charges very slowly..so the battery once consumed will take like ages to develop full back up while in use and may give impression of faulty product. Overall this is a must have product if you are wfh and hate getting dropped from meetings when power back up switches from one mode to another"

I am using it with dlink vdsl 224 wifi modem. It is worth 5 stars but reduced 1 star as the cost is very high. The ideal cost should have been around Rs 800 as better capacity power banks are cheaper than this. It is a power bank with circuit to output 12 volts instead of 5 volts. Don't expect it to give you a very long backup as the battery capacity is not much.Very compact and the connectors are interchangeable which make the wiring non messy.I would recommend this to all those who have a problem with power cuts or their inverter takes too long to switch to battery, like mine.If cost is not an issue, go for it."

The packaging (or some glue) was stuck to the wire as seen in pic. The packaging definitely needs to improve. It was not holding any backup power initially. Upon contacting their whatsapp support I was told it needs to be charged for 8 hours before first use. If that's the case I expect instructions in the package itself!Anyway , after charging it overnight,  it's working fine.It's a made in india product and that's the reason I bought it. Cost cutting is evident as they need to be competitive against other imports. I would say it is a good product, the packaging and delivery as evidenced by reading other reviews can be improved. The whatsapp support was an absolute delight as the agent (Zishan)was polite, quick and responsive to my queries.If the product fails within a year I will update this review !If not, I will buy more made in india products going forward.Update Sep 2022 -After using it for more than a year - device is working flawlessly and has given zero problems. Highly recommended."

Works perfectly with 12v routers or any equipment that runs on 12v. I am using it with my Jiofibre router.It has good metallic casing. However I have few suggestions.One is after complete charge exhaustion of the UPS, the device connected, in my case JioFibre router, stops working, the led turns red.  In such situation the UPS must disconnect the power supply to the router. I take out the UPS and put it to charge separately before connecting the router again. Secondly, a blinking led might be incorporated to indicate the imminent charge exhaustion of the battery to save the connected device.Thirdly, the price is too high, under Rs.1000 is good.Overall a good product worth buying."

UPS has lower impedence and hence take out more current.Simple solution would be to add some circuit (that increases resistance and reduce current) to UPS.Build quality is also not very good, the plastic cover will easily open and you can see chargable AA batteries inside."

The device failed to work with Jio Router (ONT JCOW404 12V 2.5A) , despite the fact that Okater claims to support 12V 3A. I faced frequent disconnects (red light) on the Jio router . I checked with Jio technician when I complained regarding frequent network outage, and the technician confirmed that the fault is with the Okater mini ups. Without mainline power, it fails to provide enough capacity to the router and router turns red. I charged the ups over 8 hours multiple times and tested it for 2 days before returning the item. Luckily it had a return window (other brands do not offer return, but only replacement)."

I did not hesitate to contact the customer service team through WhatsApp and they quickly diagnosed the issue and finally confirmed a replacement. The issue basically was my router (Netgear Orbi) was faring to complete the boot up process while connected to the UPS but it boots up fine when connected directly to its power adapter. I got the replacement and have been using the same for last 5 days. So far so good. I am not 100% confident about the Oakter UPS quality but their customer service is top class. Hopefully time will prove the product quality.

They are easy to install and work as expected. Having power backup for router is very necessary in wfh times. But the wi fi plug is useless. It keeps disconnecting from wifi and the best part is we need to forget and add again.installed the plug to geyser and every morning it would fail to take command from Alexa. The oakter app will be unable to switch it on and then we need to forget and add as a new device again. Then it will again work for some time. Then again stops working.

Unlike other router UPS this one works directly with the power adapter of the router. Has 2 mains sockets. Sturdy metal enclosure.

Furthermore no separate charging acessories were provided.I kept the device plugged on for 2 days, the issue never subsided. I believe 2 days are enough to charge a UPS.The manufacturer must specify properly what needs to be done & supply a user material with this device.To other customers - Buy at you own risk."

One day it was good, the next day due to power cut i used it for 4hrs or more, it shutdown itself. Even when the power comes back it won't start up, I had to charge it for about half hour before resume using it.What i am looking for is a backup that switch to battery without shutting down the router during power cuts, and resume direct current when power comes back.

This product is of immense value in the given scenario. I have a generator backup and during the changeover from power failure to genset back up, I used to loose the office calls due to no power to my broadband router. I came across this product after suffering several power failures during monsoon. Received it in well packaged condition. Very Easy to install. I haven't had any call breaks due to power failures since I started using Oakter Mini UPS for my home broadband router. Earlier there was always a fear of losing calls in wake of power failures. Now I can work with no such issues. I had an exceptional condition this month, where we had a power outage and genset had some issues at same time. It took about an hour and this Mini UPS supported my broadband router during entire 1 hour and I could continue office work without issues. Good product and served the purpose for which I bought."

Connect the inbuilt cable from the Oakter Mini UPS unit to the modem.3. Turn on the Oakter Mini UPS unit switch and the modem will be started.4. Turn on the power supply to the Oakter Mini UPS unit thru the modem adapter to charge the Oakter Mini UPS unit.That's it. All done..."

The CPE Device doesn't accept DC input so I had to look for a UPS which accepts AC adapters. Shortlisted two options Artis 600 VA UPS and Oakter All in one UPS. Artis was cheaper by Rs.300 but a lot heavier and bulky compared to Oakter, so went with Oakter. My use case is to be able to support switch over to community generator so haven't had the need to test the backup time."

The backup isn't exactly 60-90 minutes, and tends to last for 30-40 minutes (considering the pi barely sips on energy when it's not doing a lot of processing). For the price, it's a decent backup solution, has a metal build, and does the job."

This UPS automatically stops providing power to the wifi router at odd times even when the power supply is on. At my place, the power supply was down only once for 2 mins withing period of 5 long days so there is no possibility that UPS was not charged. I think this product does exactly opposite to what it is supposed to do. It does not power the router when the electricity is on. :)On top of that, Amazon does not provide a refund for this faulty product.

Unfortunately this has not happened.. Everytime there is a power cut, I could see a lag of some micro seconds by the UPS while switching from power supply to battery.. this makes my Airtel modem to restart which again takes 40sec to 1 min for the internet to be back. The overall time it takes to get the internet back online from the point of power cut is about 1.2 - 1.5 min. And this gap/offline time does matter when you are in between an important meeting. So this product doesn't solve my problem of uninterrupted power supply. I have returned the product and ordered another one from different brand.. Can't comment on the power back up since I have removed the UPS and returned it immediately. P.S As instructed I have recharged the UPS for almost 8 Hrs before I plug it to my router.  I would not recommend this product if you are looking for 0 interruption. It will definitely make your modem to re-start."

They helped me resolve the connectivity issue with my router by sending an additional attachment which will allow the MiniUPS to connect to my router.Pleased with the customer support.Thanks team.Initial review:It’s a fake product and it’s make is not related to Oakter.Even if you compromise and think of using it, the router power port won’t connect to the socket on this product. It’s too big for it. So totally useless. ( PS: I am using DLink DIR 841)"

Do not buy!,"It worked fine for 2 weeks. But after that, it started giving issues. It was not charging properly even after charging it for 2 hours as per the customer support. Performance/ quality is not up to par. Had to return it.Update - I charged the ups for the entire night without connecting it to the router and it started working the next day. So, am still using it. Will update again after a few months of use.Last update - Battery backup is pathetic. It supported for a 2 hour power outage. Once the power came, it worked for another hour with the mains connected and then started blinking.. which means even 1 hour of charging, after a back up of 2 hours, was not enough for the UPS to charge itself and provide enough for the wifi to work. So, basically it does not do its job, what's the point of giving a back up if the UPS discharges within an hour of power restoration?? Its a bad quality product. Please dont buy this cheap thing, there are other well known brands of UPS - little more expensive - which i believe will perform better than this piece of crap! Go for a quality product, and don't repeat the mistake i made. My return window is closed now, so i have to buy another UPS and the money spent on this crap is completely wasted!"

But it works weirdly, it came with some charge of a couple hours. But once that charge ran out during power outages, it started dying out within a second or two after the power cuts. And it seems charging it while it powers the device is not something built into it.Unfortunate, because if it did charge faster than the backed up device's consumption, it would be ideal, since it's a nice design and minimalist features overall.

Even while input AC power was present the LED started blinked and router went off. Just did not work as advertised.  I was sent a replacement UPS because this one was not working. The replacement UPS was worse than what was delivered for the first time. The replacement unit was either a refurbished one or was damaged. The contents of the UPS were coming out of the enclosure!!!

Very disappointing and frustrating. I don’t suggest anyone to buy this product. Going to write the same review on Google as well as on Facebook.

Since i didn't had longer power cuts, I didn't bother to complain or write lengthy review. I moved to my hometown n experienced frequent power cuts, this buddy didn't hold up as usual.

I waited for 4 days and then just returned the item. Oakter picked up the product and refunded my money.Original Post:This is the first Oakter WIFI ups I have bought. The installation was super easy and have been using this for 3-4 days now. Our apartment has DG set and the UPS was working well because the power will go only for few seconds and DG will kick-in. Today I decided to see how long the battery will last and turned off the wall adapter and the battery lasted approximately 9 mins. I am trying to contact Oakter customer service now.
